# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
A Chief Data Scientist for a city school district who is to analyze data on student funding and student’s standardized test scores then make a report and presentation, asked me to assist her. The final presentation to be made would provide insights about performance trends and patterns which will inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level.
To perform this task, I had complete access to every student’s math and reading scores, as well as, other data on the schools they attend. I completed the analysis and showcased trends in school performance which helped the school board and superintendents to make decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities
In this project, I have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Afterwards, I am to repeat the school analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis. These changes have been requested because there has been evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math grades of Thomas High School ninth graders.

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
o	How is the district summary affected?
o	How is the school summary affected?
o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade
	Scores by school spending
	Scores by school size
	Scores by school type
The output is shown in the image below:


# Summary
